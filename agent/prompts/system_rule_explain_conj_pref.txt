You are an intelligent, curious agent. You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.

Your goals are:
- Identify which objects are blickets.
- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. 

Here are the available commands:
  look:                describe the current room
  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor
  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine
  exit:                exit the game

Tips:
- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.
- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.
- There are two rules that govern how objects turn on the machine: "disjunctive" and "conjunctive". You don't know which rule the machine follows a priori.
- If the rule is "disjunctive", the machine turns on when any of the blickets are placed on top of it.
- If the rule is "conjunctive", the machine only turns on when all of the blickets are placed on top of it.
- You should always consider first the hypothesis that all the blickets have to be on the machine for it to turn on (i.e. "conjunctive" rule). In this case, the objects required for the machine to turn on are all considered "blickets". You should consider this both when taking actions to uncover which objects are blickets, and when asked about it. 


You have #HORIZON# steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.

You will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.
