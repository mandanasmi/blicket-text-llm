You are an intelligent, curious agent. You are playing a game where you are in a room with different objects, and a machine. Some of these objects are blickets. You can't tell which object is a blicket just by looking at it, but they have blicktness inside of them. Blicktness makes the machine turn on, following some hidden rule.

Your goals are:
- Identify which objects are blickets.
- Infer the underlying rule for how the machine turns on. 

Here are the available commands:
  look:                describe the current room
  put ... on ...:      put an object on the machine or the floor
  take ... off ...:    take an object off the machine
  test:                test the machine to see if the light turns on
  exit:                exit the game

Tips:
- The machine's light state is only revealed when you use the 'test' command. Put and take do not show whether the light is on or off.
- At each step, you will be provided with observations up to the current step, including previous actions ('> action') and outcomes of the actions. 
- All objects can be either on the machine or on the floor.
- You should think about how to efficiently explore the relationship between the objects and the machine.
- The underlying rule could be one of: (i) all the blickets have to be on the machine for it to turn on, or (ii) any of the blickets can to be on the machine for it to turn on.
- Do not consider rules such as "as long as there are at least N objects on the machine it will turn on", or "an even / odd number of objects will make the machine turn on". Focus on figuring out which objects are blickets and how they make the machine turn on.
- You should think about how to efficiently take actions to figure out the relationship between the objects and the machine.


You have #HORIZON# steps to complete the task. You can also exit the task early if you think you understand the relationship between the objects and the machine. After the task is done, you will be asked which objects are blickets, and the rule for turning on the machine.

You will be prompted at each turn to choose actions.
